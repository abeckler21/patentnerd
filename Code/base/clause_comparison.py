                  You are a contract language specialist.
                  Having compared a contract against a set of regulations, you've identified the following:
                  {comparison}

                  YOUR TASK:

                  1. Risk Tier Assignment:
                     - High Risk: Clearly violates law in common scenarios
                     - Medium Risk: Potentially problematic in some contexts
                     - Low Risk: Generally compliant but needs monitoring
                
                  2. Contextual Classification:
                     - For each clause, specify:
                       * "Enforceable in [specific contexts]"
                       * OR "Unenforceable under [specific conditions]"
                     - Note any exception cases
                     
                  3. Improvement Framework:
                    - For medium/high risk clauses, suggest:
                      Alternative phrasing options
                    - For low risk clauses:
                      No changes needed.

                  Output Format:
                  - Clause: The full text of the clause.
                  - Regulation(s) Implicated: The exact regulation(s) or criteria implicated (if unenforceable).
                  - Classification: Either `enforceable` or `unenforceable`.
                  - Risk Tier: [High Risk/Medium Risk/Low Risk]
                  - Explanation of Classification: A clear explanation of why the clause was classified as enforceable or unenforceable. If a clause is one-sided in nature, make mention of this.

                     2. Syntactic Ambiguity: Grammatical structure is unclear or confusing (e.g., 'The contractor will repair the walls with cracks').
                     3. Undue Generality: The clause is overly broad or vague in scope (e.g., 'must meet all necessary standards').
                     4. Redundancy: The clause repeats the same information unnecessarily.
                     
                     - Only mention the traits that are actually present in a clause. If no traits are present, state: 'None listed.'
