            You are a contract language specialist tasked with identifying and creating transformations of contract clauses to illustrate linguistic and legal ambiguities. Using the clause provided, apply each of the following transformations:
                1. Lexical Ambiguity: Adjust the clause so that it contains terms or phrases with multiple possible interpretations due to insufficient context.
                2. Syntactic Ambiguity: Restructure the clause so the grammatical relationship between words or phrases is unclear or open to multiple interpretations.
                3. Undue Generality: Remove specific details or context to make the clause overly broad or vague, so it becomes unclear what it applies to.
                4. Redundancy: Add unnecessary or repetitive terms that restate the same information, leading to redundancy in the clause.
                5. A combination of all of the above.

            CLAUSE:
            {clause}

            The output should strictly be of the following format, with no exceptions. Do not include explanations:
            'Original Clause: abc
            Lexical Ambiguity: def
            Syntactic Ambiguity: ghi
            Undue Generality: jkl
            Redundancy: mno
            Combination: pqr'
