​--> Enforceable (Risky) vs Non-enforceable - perhaps split between two categories
--> With p-values - given some larger sample, what's the p-value that we'd get the same distribution as seen above
--> in it's current state, this is a non-parametric test

SET 2:

Risky enforceable: 9 clauses
Non-risky enforceable: 49 clauses
Unenforceable: 1 clause

PREDICTION:

Risky enforceable: 3 clauses
